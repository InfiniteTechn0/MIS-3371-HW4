This website is a patient registration form for a fictional clinic. The patient creates their account by typing in their name, address, contact info, username and password. They are also asked to put in the previous and current health conditions if applicable. New features have been added since the HW3 edition. Cookies where the site remembers the users name if they select the "Remember Me" checkbox. Fixed headers and iFrames have been added for cosmetic purposes. The only issue is the postion of the "Remember Me" checkbox, was originally put at the bottom of the page but messed up the location of the password messages so I had to compromise and put it at the top. Could potentially just be a CSS issue, I am open to any suggestions and critiques.
